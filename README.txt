This will be a simple mod in which I test different functionalities given by Forge.
In the final stage it should contain 4 new blocks, one tool, and about 5 new recipes.

Firstly, we'll have a thermal generator, which will generate energy when it has both cold and hot blocks beside it, 
then some conducts to move the energy produced to a battery which can be connected to a console and a radio antenna just to look cool.
